<p id="secondParagraph">
    Mobile Information Systems include the communication between mobile phones and other wireless devices.
    3G/4G is a must to enable data on cellular networks,  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. These leaps in computer engineering
    let us share copy and distribute data with each other and the world. IGI global: “Mobile information systems are
    systems that rely on wireless communications and support mobile applications that typically run on wireless devices
    such as smartphones and mobile phones”( Copyright © 1988-2017, IGI Global, What is Mobile Information Systems,
    https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/mobile-information-systems/18871 ). An appropriate usage of mobile information
    systems from a business standpoint is that as a business you can create an app in order to sell your produce,
    apps are relatively low cost and require almost nothing to be distributed. For a business this is substantial because
    they’re saving money and increasing efficiency. A problem with mobile information systems is that they are much
    more penetrable and therefore much more likely to be subject to attacks. Mobile information systems have been a
    game changer in today’s world, granting businesses to connect with consumers anytime and anywhere. Ensuing a large
    growth in the economy for application based industry. Mobile information systems rely on wireless communications and
    support mobile applications that usually opperate on wireless devices such as smart phones and mobile phones”

    on many platforms and it give the customer ease of use. This is done by the use of the internet and networks,
    it allows connection between devices remotely with no wire. Through the use of applications a company's produce
    can be accessed anytime, the data is right at the customer's fingertips
