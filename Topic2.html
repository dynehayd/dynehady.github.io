<h1><u>Data Management</u></h1>
<!--here is the main amount of information-->


<p id="secondParagraph">

    Data Management is the execution of structure, practices and actions that manage and deal
    with the data of a company. Company’s large or small, in new zealand or in scotland will
    have to deal with issues that arise with data management, be it updating customer transactions
    or keeping an up to data inventory.  Data that a company must deal with can be of a very
    large quantity, this can cause problems, NG data sums up: “Data management is an administrative
    process that includes acquiring, validating, storing, protecting, and processing required data
    to ensure the accessibility, reliability, and timeliness of the data for its users.” –
    (June 9, 2017, Molly Galetto, ngdata what is data management?,  https://www.ngdata.com/what-is-data-management/).
    Obtaining data is easy for a company processing it can be difficult. In order to maximise the usage of this
    data a business must have a up to date and cutting edge data management systems . “The benefits of data
    management include enhanced compliance, greater security, improved sales and marketing strategies, better
    product classification, and improved data governance to reduce organizational risk. ”-( © 2017 Informatica, informatica

    Reflection: <br><br>

    Data management in my opinion like data itself is a subject to a broad variety of complexities.
    Data management systems to work correctly it has to keep its stored data complete, accurate and
    needs to be accessible in a timely fashion. If the said isn’t met then the data stored in the
    data management system is rendered useless Different data structures are a must in data management
    systems, such as lists, maps and tables. This makes the stored data more accurate and reliable.
    Understanding data management is also a very good idea because it helps us understand the parameters
    of the system and thus an understanding of a successful way to set it up
