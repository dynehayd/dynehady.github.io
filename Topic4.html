<h1><u>Customer Relationship Management</u></h1>
<!--here is the main amount of information-->

<p id="secondParagraph">
    Customer relationship management is the practice and strategy of
    which a company will analyse information to investigate why, how and
    when a customer will interact with the said company. The company will
    use this data analysis in order to achieve a higher quality service
    so to achieve a strengthened trust and loyalty with the customer. The
    customer will have left more satisfied with the transaction. This
    in turn will increase the growth of the business. The information is
    collected via website cookies, social media, staff interactions. The
    information is attempted to be collected from a wide variety of sources
    to obtain a greater understanding of the customer.  Data can also be
    gathered through data mining; the automated extraction of hidden predictive
    information from large databases (Rygielski, C., 2002). This uses an algorithm
    to sort the useful data from the useless data. Customer relationship
    management systems give the staff working for an organisation the ability
    to access a certain customer's data. detailing previous customer behaviour,
    purchase history and complaints. This allows an organisation to establish
    solid relationships with customers based off experience with previous
    customers. Having a successfully implemented customer relationship management
    system also allows an organisation to make educated decisions on new products
    and services they wish to release.

    Reflection: <br><br>


    Customer relationship management is essential for any business in my opinion
    because if progresses the bond between company and customer. The analysis of a
    client's data is extremely useful both ways, the business will have heightened sales
    and the customer will receive products that they want to receive. When i first found
    out how businesses obtain the information about customers i thought it wasnâ€™t right
    and somewhat a breach of privacy at times but now i understand that it is indeed for
    my own benefit.
