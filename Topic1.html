<h1><u>CLOUD COMPUTING</u></h1>
<!--here is the main amount of information-->
<p id="secondParagraph">
    Cloud Computing is a fast growing technology that is causing a drift in companies
    data storage systems. This is because cloud computing allows for data to be stored
    on an online app and allow a remote processor to do tasks for you. "An advantage
    of cloud computing is the reduction in hardware cost... new hardware can be a large,
    expensive, and inconvenience. Cloud computing alleviates these issues because
    resources can be acquired quickly and easily. " - (December 10, 2013, 4 Ways Cloud
    Computing Can Save your Company Money, Kyle Turco). Data on the ‘cloud’ is held by
    some company that allows access to it’s servers remotely via the internet to
    customers that have subscribed to it’s service. The businesses have complete security
    with their data, which means that it can only be viewed by them if they see fit.
    "Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources
    rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications."
    - (Vangie Beal, 2017). Cloud Computing is very quickly becoming a necessary part
    for businesses and ordinary people alike with its brilliance in dealing with the
    internet and all of it’s complexities. I believe this technology will not be cutting
    edge for long but become the norm, I believe it’ll save many expenses and save a lot
    of people’s time.

    Reflection: <br><br>

    I believe Cloud computing is superior for storing data and having process performed
    on it, you do not need to occupy your own disk space or cpu usage. This instead is
    handled by a secondary company. We can see a very clear transition that companies and
    users are moving to cloud computing. In my opinion cloud computing makes data more secure,
    reliable and accessible. This extends the flexibilities for companies and users because
    you don't have to access data from a fixed position in the world instead you can access
    from literally anywhere with an internet connection. This transition i believe is very
    important because it creates another industry whilst supporting another.
